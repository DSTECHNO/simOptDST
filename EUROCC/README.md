# EUROCC Case Study: Simulation-Optimization of a Patented Design with Parallel Computing on TRUBA cluster


Optimization of the baffle slot dimensions used in Contact Tanks

Stage1: Slot size optimization with variation of diagonal length (both y and z direction)

Stage2: Optimization for slot width and slot height separately

Stage3: Determining the location of the slots in the y direction and z direction with the dimensions taken from Stage 2
