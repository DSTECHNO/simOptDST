# EUROCC Case Study: Simulation-Optimization of a Patented Design with Parallel Computing on TRUBA cluster

In the scope of this case study, DSTECH intends to first optimize a design patented by EPO (European Patent Office) for the efficiency enhancement of a mixing system used in potable water treatment plants (Aral and Demirel, 2019). Definition of the problem, solution strategy and proposed optimization procedure are identified in this document.

Optimization of the baffle slot dimensions used in Contact Tanks

Stage1: Slot size optimization with variation of diagonal length (both y and z direction)

Stage2: Optimization for slot width and slot height separately

Stage3: Determining the location of the slots in the y direction and z direction with the dimensions taken from Stage 2
